Hector20004
Hello I am Hector20004, started the journey of programming april 2023, my favorite language so far is C++ but also know a bit of python. I started my first project a week ago, a window aplication of a chess game and I would also like to add a chess engine to it, but I dont know how hard all of that can be. I love chess and maths, but I also love watching anime, and enjoy doing programming exercises in codewars. I dont have a clear path in CS but I am interested in becoming a data scientist or any discpline that requieres heavy math. This was my README and my first experience in GITHUB lets see what the future have prepared for me.
